                If humanity is to maintain the lifestyle we enjoy, whilst spreading prosperity among emerging societies, it needs to make drastic changes in its resource consumption habits and switch to healthier and more renewable sources of energy. On one side where energy is still principally dependent on traditional non-renewable resources, the other side is exploring the unconventional renewable resources. Solar energy is the transitional point for us to change the way we produce and consume energy.We envision a world where every community and an individual has easy access to the knowledge and products required to construct and maintain a green footprint in terms of energy utilization.

                With about 300 clear, sunny days in a year, India's theoretical solar energy incidence on land area alone is about 5000 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh). In simple terms, the solar energy available in a year exceeds the possible energy output of all fossil fuel energy reserves in India. We, at Solar pvt ltd, believe in shortening the time it would take for us to become a solar-powered nation, and therefore seek to introduce solar awareness, technology and products in India at faster rate with greater quality and affordability.  By providing everything in the field of green energy to every customer pan India, laying special emphasis on ease of access and cost effective means of production, we look to increase solar energy output which in turn means a decrease in risk of depleting fossil fuels; thus effectively acting as a catalyst for a better Indiaacross all fronts.

                The first and foremost advantage of solar energy is that, beyond panel production, it does not emit any greenhouse gases; and post initial installation and maintenance, solar energy is free.Solar cells provide cost effective silent and non-intrusive solutions to energy problems in places where there are otherwise no means of electricity. Lacking any moving parts, they require little maintenance and have a long lifetime.Solar cells can easily be installed on roofs which means no new space is needed either in most installations.  Taken in the Indian scenario, solar power generation can serve as a major bridge between the urban and the rural communities, enabling the latter to become independently functional in a non-harmful manner.

                We envision a society harmonious and efficient in nature, enabled with clean fuel utilizing the most abundant source available throughout the year, our sun.  In order to capitalize on this virtually inexhaustible resource at hand, we take pride in providing only the most advanced and reliable solutions custom tailored to your specific needs.  Armed with global experience and expertise through our partners, and technology specially modelled to suit the Indian climate pattern, we strive to deliver cost effective solutions at competitive prices across Solar PV modules to project initiation, analysis, development, finance, design, construction and maintenance in both grid connected and off the grid solar installations on turnkey basis.

                The country is seeing a shift towards renewable sources of energy for electricity, and our goal is to fill the gap between solar energy requirement and its fulfillment through integrated marketing and networking by channelizing a perfect business model for it.  This, coupled with building a well-equipped youth bank under the Skill India and Solar India missions, will fortify India’s potential energy transition from environmentally corrosive means of power production to non-intrusive and greener alternatives.  The Solar pvt ltd aim to build a mutually harmonious societal green energy production model across urban and rural landscapes understandable, approachable and beneficial to all.
